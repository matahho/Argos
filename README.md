Argos, in Greek mythology, was a giant with a hundred eyes, famed for his vigilance and ability to watch over everything at once. No matter how many eyes were closed in rest, some always remained open. This made Argos the ideal guardian — tireless, watchful, and nearly impossible to deceive.

Inspired by this legend, Project Argos aims to bring that same level of perception and awareness to the streets through cutting-edge Federated Learning and Object Detection. Just like the mythological Argos, our system never sleeps — it sees and learns from distributed sources without compromising privacy or performance.
